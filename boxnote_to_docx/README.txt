This project was an attempt to convert all the Box Notes from a given directory in Box to docx format as the university transferred all of its files from Box to OneDrive. I was working as a web developer for the [Mizzou Career Center](https://career.missouri.edu/) and tried to help out. Unfortunately I failed.

The problem was that the images in the .html file that I create are specified by absolute URLs to a Box shared link, need them on the file system; the URLs cannot be accessed properly by my script and I was not sure how to fix that.
