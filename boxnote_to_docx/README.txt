This project was an attempt to convert all the Box Notes from a given directory in Box to docx format

I failed but learned some python

the problem is that the images in the html file that I create are specified by absolute URLs to a Box shared link, need them on the file system

I raised an issue on the guy's Github and if I have time at work with nothing else to do, this is something to build then
