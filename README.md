# Box-Notes-to-Docx
Converts files from .boxnote file format to .docx file format.

Mizzou was transitioning from Box to OneDrive at the time, and I was working as a web developer for the MU Career Center. I was tasked with helping out
in the transition by converting a large number of files from the .boxnote format to the .docx file format, so I wrote a script in python that kind of works.
